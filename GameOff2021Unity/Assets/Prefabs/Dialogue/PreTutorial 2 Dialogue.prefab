  - name: Analysis
    message: Good job, team.
  - name: Analysis
    message: Initiate, you may have noticed that we have Macros at our disposal.
  - name: Analysis
    message: We may encounter bugs that are resistant to our normal Attacks.
  - name: Vanguard
    message: In those cases, Analysis and I can cast Macros that strengthen the power
      of our Attacks.
  - name: Vanguard
    message: Of course, they affect us all simultaneously. However, they don't stack
      further than twice so don't make that mistake again, Analysis.
  - name: Vanguard
    message: Alternatively, you, Initiate, were taught Macros that deal Macro damage,
      which bypasses any physical resistance of these intrusive Bugs.
  - name: Analysis
    message: Macros cost a certain amount of AP to cast, so use them wisely. It's
      like magic or stamina in a game.
  - name: Analysis
    message: That would make you our caster Initiate. Vanguard's the tank, and I'm
      the support. The perfect party!
  - name: Analysis
    message: Initiate, you've got the big guns. I say we practice on that cube over
      there.
  - name: Analysis
    message: From my ANALYSIS *smiles*, that one looks to be resistant to our normal
      Attacks.
  - name: Vanguard
    message: I recommend casting Debug to quickly eliminate it, Initiate.
  - name: Initiate
    message: Copy that.
